ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project â€“ HR Analytics Dashboard built on Tableau!

This dashboard provides powerful insights into workforce data by tracking key HR metrics such as:
âœ… Employee demographics & diversity distribution
âœ… Attrition trends & retention analysis
âœ… Performance & productivity indicators
âœ… Department-wise insights for decision-making

The goal behind this project was to make HR data more interactive, insightful, and decision-driven so that organizations can identify trends, improve retention, and make better talent-related decisions.

ðŸ’¡ Building this dashboard helped me strengthen my skills in:

Data Visualization & Storytelling with Tableau

HR Analytics & KPI mapping

Turning raw data into actionable business insights
