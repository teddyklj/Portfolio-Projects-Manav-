🌟 Thrilled to share my recent project – Blinkit Sales Dashboard built using Power BI!

This dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive view of business performance by analyzing:
📊 Sales trends & revenue growth
🛒 Product category performance
📍 Regional & store-wise insights
👥 Customer purchase behavior & demand patterns

The aim was to turn raw sales data into actionable insights that can help drive data-backed decisions in areas like inventory planning, product optimization, and customer engagement.

💡 Key learnings from this project:

Advanced Power BI visualizations & DAX functions

Building interactive dashboards for real-time decision-making

Applying data storytelling to retail & e-commerce analytics

This project not only enhanced my Power BI & Data Analytics skills but also gave me practical exposure to how businesses like Blinkit can leverage analytics for growth.

Looking forward to feedback from the community! 🚀
